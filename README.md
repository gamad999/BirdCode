# BirdCode

The BirdCode Project is a training program proposal for Python basics learning in high school which presents to the educational community a set of contents focused in three main objectives: the design of a simple birdâ€™s name guessing game, taking advantage of the ludic opportunity to introduce the students in the algorithms development using the Python sintaxis, encouraging an active role for the biology, biodiversity and bilinguism concepts integration through a classroom research framework.
